## Music Notation Database:

## 1150 Academy Team Fire Blue Badge Group API Project

# Project Summary:

This project is designed as a proof of concept for an API that handles data associated with a Music Notation Database Web App similar to the function of the website [Imslp](https://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page).

More specifically, it allows a user to view information about classical compositions stored in the Database, including relationships between compositions and other entities stored across multiple tables.

Users may also show their preferences on pieces and composers through update endpoints that edit a record of views and preferences for each composer and piece.

Administrators can use token Authorization to edit information stored in data tables, with the ability to create, update, and delete new entries.
